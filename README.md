# ✅ Deadly simple tasks

This is, as in its name, a **deadly simple task** manager. I've used a lot of 
to-do apps before, from Microsoft ToDo to GNOME Tasks. 

All of them marvelous, but none of them simple as I want. Too many subtasks, 
links, categories and options. 

All I want was an app to pop up, write down a simple task and *done*. None of 
them has a small footprint to use it this way, nor fit perfectly my requirements.

✨ **Deadly simple tasks** is my solution.

## Features

This is a Linux flatpak offline-first app. Which means that synchronization 
features are not available. It was designed to keep all information local, 
aiming to improve user's privacy.

### Offline-first, privacy-oriented

This app does not have any tracking and/or analytics scripts. This means that 
the only way to give a feedback is contact author. 

### Simple management

There is only one single focus: handle my tasks. The following actions are 
essential, assembling the application core:

* ✏️ Write down a task
* ✍️ Edit if you want
* ✅ Mark as Done
* 🗑️ Or delete permanently
* 🤖 Clean all finished tasks

### Export tasks

> [!Note]
> The export function should export current tasks overall panorama
