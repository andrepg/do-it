# ✅ Deadly simple tasks

This is, as in its name, a **deadly simple task** manager. I've used a lot of 
to-do apps before, from Microsoft ToDo to GNOME Tasks. 

All of them marvelous, but none of them simple as I want. Too many subtasks, 
links, categories and options. 

All I want was an app to pop up, write down a simple task and *done*. None of 
them has a small footprint to use it this way, nor fit perfectly my requirements.

✨ **Deadly simple tasks** is my solution.

## Features

This is a Linux flatpak offline-first app. Which means that synchronization 
features are not available. It was designed to keep all information local, 
aiming to improve user's privacy.

### Offline-first, privacy-oriented

This app does not have any tracking and/or analytics scripts. This means that 
the only way to give a feedback is contact author. 

### Simple management

There is only one single focus: handle my tasks. The following actions are 
essential, assembling the application core:

* ✏️ Write down a task
* ✍️ Edit if you want
* ✅ Mark as Done
* 🗑️ Or delete permanently
* 🤖 Clean all finished tasks

### Local database

> [!Note]
> As noted before, this app is privacy-oriented. 

Your tasks are stored locally, in a JSON file inside the app data itself. 
In a Linux Flatpak environment, it should be `~/.var/app/io.github.andrepg.Doit/data`. 

🔄 _If you want to make your own backup, that's the folder!_

🎯 _We plan to create another JSON file, to keep a user actions history and allow to undo actions._

### Export tasks

> [!Note]
> We do plan to create a export function, but not now.
