# ✅ Do It

This is a **deadly simple task** manager. I've used a lot of 
to-do apps before, from Microsoft ToDo (and the old good Wunderlist) to GNOME Tasks. 

All of them marvelous, but none of them simple as I want. Too many subtasks, 
links, categories and options. 

All I want was an app to pop up, write down a simple task and *done*. None of 
them has a small footprint to use it this way, nor fit perfectly my requirements.

✨ **Do It** is my solution.

## Features

This is a Linux flatpak offline-first app. Which means that synchronization 
features are not available. It was designed to keep all information local, 
aiming to improve user's privacy.

### Offline-first, privacy-oriented

This app does not have any tracking and/or analytics scripts. This means that 
the only way to give a feedback is contact author by using our 
[Discussions threads](https://github.com/andrepg/do-it/discussions). 

### Simple management

There is only one single focus: _handle my tasks_. The following actions are 
essential, assembling the application core:

* ✏️ Write down a task
* ✍️ Edit if you want
* ✅ Mark as Done
* 🗑️ Or delete permanently
* 🤖 Clean all finished tasks (WIP [#11](https://github.com/andrepg/do-it/issues/11))
* 📤️ Export and import your tasks

## Roadmap 

The current roadmap to this application is available in the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/andrepg/projects/8).
